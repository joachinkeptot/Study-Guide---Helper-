## What's Different From Old Version?

**REMOVED** (too complex):

- ❌ PDF uploads

- ❌ Hints system
- ❌ Streaks
- ❌ Progress analytics

**KEPT** (essential):

## If You Have Issues

The old complex features are still in the app (Dashboard, etc). You can ignore them.

It's isolated from all the buggy complex stuff.

## Tips

- Practice one topic until you feel confident
- Read the explanations even when you're correct
- Use specific topics: "derivatives of trig functions" not just "calculus"
- The AI is smart - it won't repeat exact questions
- No time limit, no pressure, just practice
